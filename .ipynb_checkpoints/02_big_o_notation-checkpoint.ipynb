    "- Generally you want to choose the most efficient algorithm; wheter you're trying to optimize for time or space.\n",
    "- Back to [Binary Search](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/01_searching_algorithm.ipynb?). How much do you save by using it?\n",
    "- Well, the first approach was to check each number, one by one (**Simple Search**). If this is a list of 100 numbers, it takes up to 100 guesses. If it's a list of 4 billion numbers, it takes up to 4 billion guesses.\n",
    "- So the maximum number of guesses is the same as the size of the list. This is called **Linear Time**.\n",
    "- **Binary Search** is different. If the list is 100 items long, it takes at most 7 guesses. If the list is 4 billion items, it takes up to 32 guessess.\n",
    "- **Binary Search** runs **logarithmic time** (or log time, as the natives call it).\n",

    "## Algorithm running times grow at different rates [2/6]\n",
    "- Bob is trying to decide between **Simple Search** and **Binary Search**.\n",
    "- The algorithm needs to be fast and correct.\n",
    "- On one hand, **Binary Search** is faster.\n",
    "- On the other hand, **Simple Search** is easier to write, and there is a less chance of bugs being introduced. And Bob doesn't want bugs in the code to land a rocket!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm running times grow at different rates [3/6]\n",
    "- Let's assume it takse 1 milisecond to check one element.\n",
    "- To be extra careful, Bob decides to time both algorithms with a list of 100 elements.\n",
    "- With **Simple Search**, Bob has to check 100 elements, so the search takes 100ms to run.\n",
    "- On the other hand, he only has to check 7 elements with **Binary Search** ($log_{2} 100$ is roughly 7), so that search takes 7ms to run.\n",

    "## Algorithm running times grow at different rates [4/6]\n",
    "- But realisticly, the list wil have more like a billion elements.\n",
    "- Bob runs **Binary Search** with 1 billion elements, and it takes 30ms ($log_{2} 1,000,0000,000$ is roughly 30).\n",
    "- **Binary Search** is about 15ms times faster than **Simple Search**, because **Simple Search** took 100ms with 100 elements, and **Binary Search** took 7ms.\n",
    "- So **Simple Search** will take 30 x 15 = 450ms, right? Way under my threshold of 10 seconds.\n",
    "- Bob decides to go with **Simple Search**.\n",
    "- Is that the right choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm running times grow at different rates [5/6]\n",
    "- No! Turns out, Bob is wrong.\n",
    "- The run time for **Simple Search** with 1 billion elements will be 1 billion ms, which is 11 days!\n",
    "- The problem is, the run times for **Binary Search** and **Simple Search** don't grow at the same rate.\n",

    "## Algorithm running times grow at different rates [6/6]\n",
    "- As the number of items increases, **Binary Search** takes a litte more time to run, but **Simple Search** takes a lot more time to run.\n",
    "- So as the list of numbers gets bigger, **Binary Search** suddenly becomes more faster than **Simple Search**.\n",
    "- That's why it's not enough to know how long an algorithm takes to run, you need to know how the running time increases as the list size increases.\n",
    "- That's where Big O Notation comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big O Notation explained [1/2]\n",
    "- Big O Notation tells you how fast an algorithm is.\n",
    "- For example, suppose you have a list size of $n$.\n",
    "- **Simple Search** needs to check each element, so it will take $n$ operations. The run time in Big O Notation is O($n$),\n",
    "- Big O doesn't tell you the speed in seconds. Big O Notation lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big O Notation explained [2/2]\n",
    "- **Binary Search** needs $log n$ operations to check a list of size $n$.\n",
    "- What's the running time in Big O Notation? It's O($log n$).\n",
