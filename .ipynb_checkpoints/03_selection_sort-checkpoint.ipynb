    "- Selection sort sorting algorithm runs $O(n^2)$ (quadratic time), because it needs to iterate over the list twice. The first iteration needs to iterate from the begining index until the end of the list index and so with the second iteration, it needs to iterate from the begining index until the end of the list index. Therefore, the run time is $O(n\\times n)$ or $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "- As the size of the input increases, the time required for the selection sort algorithm grows quadratically. For example, with a list of 5 elements, the algorithm performs $5\\times 5 = 25$ comparisons in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Note that not all nested loops are consideres has quadratic time complexity or $O(n^2)$. The reason selection sort algorithm runs  quadratic time complexity or $O(n^2)$ is because the first loop needs to iterate over the list from the begining index until the end of the index, and so on with the second iteration loop."
