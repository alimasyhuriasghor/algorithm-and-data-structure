# Assalamualaikum, hi! Welcome to my Algorithm and Data Structure repository.
This repository contains my Algorithm and Data Strucutre tutorials across all sources. Each Algorithm and Data Structure tutorials will have their own branches, and references from where i borrow it, but of course if i already finished the tutorial i will merge the branch into the main branch.

# What is an Algorithm and Data Structure?
To put it simply Algorithm is a set of instructions for accomphlising a task, whereas a Data Structure is a way to store, and manage a data in our computer so that it can be accesed and used it effiecently.
