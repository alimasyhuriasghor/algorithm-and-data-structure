# Hi! Welcome to my from-indonesia-belajar Algorithm and Data structure branch.
This branch will mainly focus my Algorithm and Data structure tutorial from [Indonesia Belajar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa-cnoUkNbU&list=PL2O3HdJI4voEOEB5ecXtCTayzXSB8b3KZ&pp=iAQB). The video is a recorded lecture.

Indonesia Belajar also borrowed the references from grokking algorithm book. The book is also available online, you can [click here](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) to learn furthermore about what grokking algorithms book is.

Most of the notebook files are my notes when i watch the recorded lecture.
